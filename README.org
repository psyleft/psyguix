Personal Guix channel

* About
This is my personal collection of recpies for GNU Guix, packaged into a public channel. I make no gaurantees that anything here will work, though I'm probably using it myself. If this doesn't concern you, feel free to add the repository to your ~channels.scm~. Licensing information can be found in the ~LICENSE~ file in the project root. If any of the code here is taken from another source, I make my best effort to indicate that is the case and follow the applicable licensing requirements.

If you have any improvements to suggest please contact me on GitHub or through email at =connor@psyleft.com=.
